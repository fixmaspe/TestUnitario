# Welcome to Unit Testing!

![welcome jest](../../assets/welcome.png)

Today you will be creating a small unit converter in node.js (javascript) using Test Driven Development.

Test driven development means that we will develop the tests first, and the functionalities later.

## Requirements:

1. Before starting to code our project lets make sure we have node version 12+: You can type on your terminal the following command: `$ node -v` and it will return your current node version.

Open a new terminal window and write the following command on your terminal: 

```bash
$ node -v
```

#### ğŸ’¡ Help

If you are using Gitpod or VSCode you can open a new terminal by clicking on the top menu `terminal -> new terminal`.
