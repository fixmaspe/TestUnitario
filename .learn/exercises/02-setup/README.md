# `01` Setup our project

There are many great alternatives to create unit tests using javascript or node like: Mocha, Jasmin or Jest. 
We decided to use Jest because currently is the most popular one, with most documentation and better integrated with React.js.

## Package manager

The Jest library can be downloaded into your project thru [node package manager (npm)](https://npmjs.com), npm is the most popular package manager in javascript/node.

## 📝 Instructions

Before installing jest, we have to initialize the project with the npm init commant ideal to setup NPM. 

Run the following command to start your project using npm package manager:

```bash
$ npm init -y
```

Note: If you don't add the `-y` option it will ask lots of questions that we don't need.

## ✅ Check for success

If you installed successfully you will find a `package.json` file on your project root.
